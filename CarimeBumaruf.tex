\section{Nice to Meet You!}
As a physicist and banking trader I learned to combine my analytical knowledge with the understanding of the business
and corporate world. Within this select group of professionals I worked with, the feedback I received highly prized my
communication, relational, and negotiation skills as well as my ability to work within an environment of emerging
technologies and their solutions. Now, I'm striving to succeed in a Computer Science course as a complement to my
career shift plan.
